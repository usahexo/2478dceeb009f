#  Best Carry Out in Blackjack? You Win What Percentage?

There are a lot of carry out decisions in blackjack, and sometimes it can be hard to know what the best move is. In this article, we'll take a look at what the best carry out is in blackjack, as well as what percentage of the time you can expect to win by making that particular choice.

The best carry out in blackjack is simply to stand, as this gives you the best chance to win the hand. If you're close to 21, it's generally better to hit than to stand, as you have a better chance of going over 21 if you hit. However, if you're already over 21, it's generally better to stand than to hit.

In general, you can expect to win about 47% of the time by standing in blackjack. This number may vary depending on the specific circumstances involved in each hand, but standing is generally your best option.

#  How to Play and Win at Carry Out in Blackjack

Carry out in blackjack is one of the most common and popular side bets in the game. It’s also one of the easiest to play and offers a decent payout.

The carry out bet pays out if your first two cards are a pair. The payout varies depending on the casino, but it’s usually around even money – for example, paying out 1:1 for a pair of kings.

To place a carry out bet, simply bet an amount equal to your main bet on the box marked “Carry Out” beside the dealer’s up card. If you have a pair with your first two cards, you win!

The carry out bet is a great way to add some excitement to the game and increase your chances of winning. Remember that it’s important to always play within your limits, however, as the house edge on this bet is relatively high.

#  What is the Best Carry Out in Blackjack Strategy?

There are a lot of different blackjack strategies that people can use when they are playing the game. Some people like to use basic strategy, while others like to use more advanced strategies.

#  Carry Out in Blackjack - How to win every time!

When you're playing blackjack in hopes of winning some money, it's important to have a plan and know the right way to play. Many people believe that card counting is the key to winning at blackjack, but in reality, it's all about knowing when to hit and when to stand. This guide is designed to teach you how to carry out in blackjack so that you can win every time.

To start off, let's take a look at the basic rules of blackjack. In this game, each player is dealt two cards face down, and the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player can either hit (take another card) or stand (end the turn). If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose automatically. The dealer then also draws cards until they have 17 or more, and must stand on any total of 17 or higher.

The first step in carrying out in blackjack is deciding when to hit and when to stand. Generally speaking, you'll want to hit if your total is below 12 and stand if your total is 17 or above. However, there are other factors to consider as well. For example, if the dealer has a low card (2 through 6), you'll want to hit even if your total is high because there's a good chance they'll bust. On the other hand, if the dealer has a high card (7 through Ace), you'll want to stand even if your total is low because they're more likely to bust.

In addition, you'll also want to take into account the cards that have already been played. For example, if you have an Ace and a 3, you should hit against most dealers since they're likely to have a low card that will give them less than 18. However, if the dealer has an Ace showing, you should stand since they're likely to have a high card and will therefore beat you no matter what else happens.

Finally, remember that blackjack is all about making smart decisions based on the particular situation. There's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to hitting or standing; everything depends on what cards are currently showing and what cards remain in the deck. By using this guide as a starting point and adapting as necessary, you'll be able to carry out in blackjack like a pro and win every time!
