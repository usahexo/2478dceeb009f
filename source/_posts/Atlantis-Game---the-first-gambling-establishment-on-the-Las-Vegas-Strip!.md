#  Atlantis Game - where history was made in gambling!

The Atlantis game was first conceptualized in the 1970s, by a group of casino owners who wanted to create a new game that would revolutionize gambling. The game was finally released to the public in 1992, and it soon became one of the most popular casino games in history.

The Atlantis game is a combination of blackjack and poker. It is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and each player is dealt five cards. The goal of the game is to make the best five card hand possible, using any combination of your five cards and the cards on the table. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins.

The Atlantis game has several unique features that make it different from other casino games. First, there are no wild cards in the game. This makes it more difficult to win, but also more rewarding when you do win. Second, there is a side bet that can be made on each hand. This side bet pays out based on the rank of your hand, and can be very lucrative if you hit a royal flush or four-of-a-kind. Finally, there is an optional bonus round that can be played after each hand. This bonus round allows players to wager their entire pot on a single hand of poker. If they win, they get to keep all of the money in the pot; if they lose, they lose everything they have wagered.

The Atlantis game has become one of the most popular casino games because it offers excitement and suspense that other games cannot match. It is a challenging game that requires skill and strategy, but it is also accessible to beginners who want to learn how to play blackjack and poker. And with its high payouts and thrilling bonus rounds, Atlantis offers some of the best gambling excitement available today
