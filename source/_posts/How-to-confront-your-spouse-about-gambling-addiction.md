#  How to confront your spouse about gambling addiction

In any marriage, confronting your spouse about any addiction can be difficult. When it comes to gambling, however, there are some specific things you need to keep in mind.

First, understand that gambling addiction is a real thing. It’s not something your spouse is doing to spite you. Gambling addicts are actually neurologically different than non-addicts. This means that they don’t have the same ability to control their impulses as someone without an addiction.

Second, realize that your spouse is most likely not going to want to hear what you have to say. They may become defensive and try to justify their behavior. You need to be prepared for this and remain calm yourself.

Third, make sure you have all of the facts. You don’t want to confront your spouse with incomplete or inaccurate information. This will only lead to more arguments and resentment on both sides.

When you do confront your spouse, here are some things you can say:

“I love you and I want you to get help for your gambling addiction. I’m not happy with the way this is affecting our family. I want us to be healthy and happy together again.”

“I know this is a difficult thing for you to talk about, but we need to address it head-on if we want our relationship to survive. Gambling addiction is a real problem and it needs to be treated.”

“I know it’s hard for you to admit that you have a problem, but I’m here for you no matter what happens. We can get through this together if you are willing to seek treatment."
