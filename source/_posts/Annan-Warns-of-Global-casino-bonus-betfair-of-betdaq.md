#  Annan Warns of Global casino bonus betfair of betdaq

United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan today warned of a global "casino culture" in which the gap between rich and poor was growing ever wider.

In his final speech to the general assembly, Mr Annan stressed the need to rein in transnational corporations and protect the environment. He also urged developed countries to honour their commitments to provide development aid.

Mr Annan's warnings came as the UN prepares to launch its biggest-ever peacekeeping operation, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The secretary-general said he had been struck by the "gloomy mood" at this year's assembly and warned of a global backlash against free trade.

"Too often, we see the developing world caught in a downward spiral of debt, poverty and environmental destruction," he said. "At the same time, we are seeing an alarming increase in inequality within and among societies."

He added: "We are witnessing a growing acceptance of violence and impunity, and a weakening of democratic institutions." In this context, Mr Annan called for greater regulation of transnational corporations - many of which were based in developed countries.

"We must ensure that they act responsibly - not only by respecting international law but also by contributing to sustainable development," he said. "And we must give developing countries a stronger voice in decisions that affect them."

#  Annan Calls for Urgent casino bonus betfair of betdaq

Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for an urgent international response to the escalating humanitarian crisis in Darfur on Wednesday, warning that the situation could turn into “a genocide”.

In a speech to the UN Security Council, Annan said the world could not stand idly by while innocent civilians were being killed and raped.

“We cannot allow this crisis to become a genocide. We must act now,” he said.

Annan said the Security Council should set up a trust fund to help finance relief operations and consider establishing a UN peacekeeping force for Darfur. He also called for sanctions against those blocking relief efforts.

The United States has been pushing for such a force but Russia and China, both of which have close ties to Sudan, have been reluctant to endorse it.

Sudan has rejected outside intervention in Darfur, insisting that it can handle the crisis on its own. It has accused insurgents of stirring up trouble in the region and says more than two million people have been displaced because of fighting between government forces and rebels.

Human rights groups say more than 200,000 people have died in Darfur since the conflict began in 2003.

#  Annan: The World Is On the Edge casino bonus betfair of betdaq

Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned the world is on the "edge of a abyss" and could be descending into chaos.

In an interview with The Guardian, Mr Annan said the UN was not doing enough to address the Syrian conflict and the global refugee crisis.

"The world is on edge," he said. "We are in danger of descending into chaos and fragmentation."

Mr Annan – who will launch a foundation aimed at resolving international conflicts – also criticised Europe's response to the refugee crisis, saying it had been "slow and inadequate".

He accused European leaders of lacking political will and being short-sighted.

"It's very frustrating," he said. "You have a lot of refugees who are in desperate need, you have neighbouring countries that are bearing the brunt, you have Europe which could do more, and yet you don't see the political will to do something about it."

#  Annan Calls for Leadership on casino bonus betfair of betdaq

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday called for courageous leadership to tackle the complex challenges of climate change, conflict and peacebuilding, and sustainable development.

“I urge all leaders – both within Governments and outside – to show the courage to take the long view, to think beyond the next election or financial quarter, and to make decisions based on the common good,” he said in his annual address to the General Assembly.

In a wide-ranging speech, Mr. Ban also urged action on humanitarian crises in Syria, South Sudan, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Iraq; voiced alarm at the Ebola epidemic in West Africa; warned against escalating nuclear tensions between Russia and Ukraine; and called for progress on UN reform.

Turning to climate change – which he called “the defining challenge of our era” – Mr. Ban said that 2015 will be a critical year, with countries expected to reach an agreement in Paris that could usher in a new era of low-carbon growth and climate resilience.

“We must get it right this time. The stakes are high: Our very survival is at stake. So I appeal to all countries – developed and developing alike – to come forward with bold plans and contributions that demonstrate genuine leadership towards a durable global climate agreement in Paris,” he said.

On conflicts, Mr. Ban said that while military solutions are sometimes necessary, they are not enough on their own. He stressed the need for political solutions based on inclusive dialogue and respect for human rights.

“This is especially true in cases such as Syria, where we see combatant groups using sectarianism and religious extremism to fuel violence. We must break this vicious cycle by addressing the root causes of these conflicts: poverty, marginalization, exclusion and lack of accountable governance,” he said.

Mr. Ban also called for greater efforts to build sustainable peace through measures such as good governance, equitable development and strengthened institutions. “Sustainable peace is about more than just an absence of war; it is about creating societies that are just and inclusive where all people can live in dignity and have a say in their future,” he said.

#  Annan Urges Action on casino bonus betfair ofbetdaq

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today called for concerted global action to halt the alarming spread of the Zika virus, as he briefed the Security Council on the outbreak.

"I urge concerted global action to halt this alarming spread of the Zika virus," said Mr. Ban. "We must all work together to protect our people."

Members of the Security Council expressed serious concern about the rapid spread of Zika virus, which has now been linked to serious birth defects and neurological disorders. The Secretary-General called for an urgent response that is both coordinated and effective.

"This is a public health emergency, and we need to act decisively," said Mr. Ban. "Hundreds of millions of people could be affected if we do not take strong and urgent action."

The Secretary-General noted that Member States have already taken important steps, such as increasing monitoring and sharing information. He urged all countries to do what they can to halt the spread of Zika virus, including providing necessary funding and technical assistance.
