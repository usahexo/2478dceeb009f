#  Amatic Just Over in the Next County For Georgia Players

In February, Amatic announced they would be ceasing operations in the state of Georgia. This affects both the state's greyhound industry and casino players.

As a company, Amatic Industries is headquartered in Austria. Their products have been seen in casinos around the world, with a particular focus on Eastern Europe and Asia. However, with the expansion of gambling laws in the United States, they set their sights on the southeastern market.

In Georgia specifically, they entered into an agreement with the state's two racetracks: zeitgeist greyhound racing in Macon and Gwinnett County Downs. Under this agreement, Amatic supplied over 1,000 gaming machines to the two tracks. They were also responsible for providing support services and payroll.

However, due to recent changes in US gambling laws, Amatic Industries has made the decision to exit the Georgian market. This leaves both greyhound racing venues without key suppliers and more than 1,000 casino players without access to their games.

It's unclear what will happen to these venues and players now that Amatic is pulling out. Both zeitgeist greyhound racing and Gwinnett County Downs have declined to comment on the matter.
