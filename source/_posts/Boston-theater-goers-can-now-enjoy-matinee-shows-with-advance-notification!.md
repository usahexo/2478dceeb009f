# Boston theater-goers can now enjoy matinee shows with advance notification!

Boston theatergoers will now enjoy matinee shows with advance notification! Matinees are often discounted and offer a shorter performance than evening shows. However, they can be difficult to attend because the time of the show is not known until the days leading up to it.

Now, The Boston Globe has partnered with the Huntington Theatre Company, American Repertory Theater, and SpeakEasy Stage Company to allow audiences to reserve seats in advance for matinee performances. This way, theatergoers know the time of the show before they buy tickets and can plan their day accordingly.

The Globe’s Arts Editor, Jeremy D. Goodwin, says that this new system “should be great news for downtown office workers who want to catch a play during their lunch break but don’t want to gamble on what time the curtain will go up.”

# Broadway Roulette now offers matinee show notifications for Boston theater-goers!

Broadway Roulette, the popular online ticketing service for theater-goers in New York City, is now expanding its services to Boston theater-goers! Broadway Roulette offers matinee show notifications so that theater-goers can be alerted when there are discounted tickets available for matinee performances.

This new service will help Boston theater-goers save money on their theater tickets and enjoy the experience of attending a Broadway show without having to worry about last minute planning. Broadway Roulette has already partnered with a number of theaters in the Boston area, including the recently renovated Cutler Majestic Theater.

For those who are not familiar with Broadway Roulette, it is an online ticketing service that allows users to purchase tickets to Broadway shows at discounted prices. Broadway Roulette offers customers two different types of discounts: a last minute discount and a pre-order discount.

The last minute discount is available to customers who purchase tickets within 48 hours of the performance date. The pre-order discount is available to customers who purchase tickets at least two weeks in advance of the performance date.

In addition to these discounts, Broadway Roulette also offers a number of exclusive benefits to its users, including front row seats, express entry into the theater, and a complimentary drink from the concessions stand.

To take advantage of this new service, Boston theater-goers can visit https://www.broadwayroulette.com/boston and select the "Notifications" tab from the menu bar at the top of the page. From there, they can enter their email address and select "Matinee Shows" from the "Show Types" menu.

Broadway Roulette will then send an email notification to subscribers whenever there are discounted tickets available for matinee performances at theaters in Boston.

# Boston theater-goers can now take advantage of earlier showtimes with Broadway Roulette notifications!

The app, which was created in 2016 by then-18-year-old high school student Jeremy Fdoctoroff, has been a success in New York City and is now expanding to other theatrical hubs.

How does it work?

The Broadway Roulette app sends notifications to its users when a show has an earlier available start time. For example, if you're interested in seeing "Hamilton," the notification might say that there is an 8 p.m. showtime available instead of the usual 8:30 p.m. showtime.

The great thing about Broadway Roulette is that it's not just limited to "Hamilton"! You can use the app to find earlier showtimes for any Broadway show in New York City or Boston. This is a great way to avoid crowds and enjoy a more relaxed theater experience.

# Broadway Roulette offers matinee show notifications for Boston theater-goers!

The company’s mission is “to make the theatergoing experience more fun and less daunting for everyone. We want to help people feel like they can take a chance on something new and see amazing performances without having to plan too far ahead. Plus, we just love Broadway!”

Broadway Roulette also works with partners including Hot Tixx and ShowTickets.com to give its subscribers access to discounted tickets for select shows.

Second, Broadway Roulette sends out waitlist notifications for popular shows that are sold out. By being added to the waitlist, theater-goers have a better chance of getting tickets since last minute cancellations often happen.

Last, but not least, Broadway Roulette sends out flash sale notifications for up to 50% off tickets to select shows. These sales are announced anywhere from a few hours to a few days before the show date.

Since its inception, Broadway Roulette has partnered with theaters including The Shubert Organization (which owns seventeen theaters on Broadway), Ambassador Theater Group (which owns four West End theaters), The Public Theater (an Off-Broadway theater), Second Stage Theater (an Off-Broadway theater), and Roundabout Theater Company (a Off-Broadway theater).
