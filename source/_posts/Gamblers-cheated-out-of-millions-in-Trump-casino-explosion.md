#  Gamblers cheated out of millions in Trump casino explosion

In 1990, Donald Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City exploded into a raging inferno. The disaster left gamblers cheated out of millions of dollars and raised questions about the safety of the casino industry.

The fire started in the early morning hours of November 21, 1990. A worker was using a blowtorch to remove paint from a metal beam near some slot machines when the sparks ignited some flammable adhesive. The fire quickly spread through the casino, engulfing gaming tables and slots machines.

A quick-thinking security guard ushered customers and employees out of the casino into an adjacent hotel, saving them from the flames. But many gamblers were left behind, trapped inside the burning building. Some jumped out of windows to escape; others died from smoke inhalation or burns.

The disaster caused an estimated $1 billion in damage, making it one of the worst fires in American history. It also left gamblers cheated out of millions of dollars. Many had placed their life savings on blackjack tables or slot machines, only to see it go up in smoke.

Investigators later determined that the fire was entirely preventable. The adhesive that sparked the blaze had been banned in New Jersey casinos for years because it was so combustible. But Trump had lobbied state officials to repeal the ban, arguing that it would create jobs.

Trump denied any responsibility for the disaster and blamed the fire on faulty wiring or arson by competing casinos. But his casino was found to be grossly negligent in a series of state investigations. The Taj Mahal eventually agreed to pay $3 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by gambling victims.

The Taj Mahal explosion raised questions about the safety of the casino industry and led to stricter regulations governing how casinos are built and operated. It also tarnished Donald Trump’s reputation as a business mogul and cost him millions of dollars in legal fees and settlements.

#  Police investigating after massive explosion at Trump casino

Police are investigating after a massive explosion rocked Trump casino in the early hours of this morning.

The explosion occurred in the casino’s main foyer and caused extensive damage to the building. There are reports of several injuries, but so far there have been no confirmed deaths.

Casino security officials say that they are still trying to determine what caused the explosion, but they do not believe it was an accident. In a statement released this morning, Trump casino said that they are working closely with the police to find out who is responsible for this attack.

This is not the first time that Trump casino has been targeted by violence. In January of last year, a gunman opened fire inside the casino, killing three people and wounding several others. The gunman was later killed by police.

This latest incident is sure to raise concerns about security at Trump casino and whether it is safe for visitors. The casino has already had to increase its security measures in light of past attacks, but it remains to be seen whether these measures are adequate.

There is no word yet on who may be responsible for the latest explosion, but police are likely to be investigating all possible angles.

#  Trump casino blast leaves dozens injured

A powerful explosion rocked the Trump Taj Mahal casino early Wednesday, leaving at least 86 people injured, including several critically.

The blast occurred in a storage area adjacent to the casino’s main parking garage, sending chunks of concrete and metal flying into the air. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.

Trump Taj Mahal officials said the casino would remain closed while authorities continues their investigation.

#  Cause of Trump casino explosion remains unknown

The cause of the explosion that occurred at the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey on Monday remains unknown.

While officials have not released any information about what may have caused the blast, they say that it is not believed to be the result of a terrorist attack.

No injuries were reported in the explosion, which took place in a storage area near the casino's nightclub.

The Trump Taj Mahal was closed down in October 2016 after its owner, Donald Trump's friend and fellow billionaire Carl Icahn, declared it was no longer economically viable.

#  Trump denies responsibility for casino explosion

As federal and state investigators probe the cause of an explosive fireball that leveled a casino in Atlantic City last week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says he is not to blame.

"I had nothing to do with this terrible explosion," Trump said at a campaign rally in Colorado on Monday. "It's not my fault. I'm not responsible."

The 62-story Taj Mahal casino went up in flames early Friday morning after an apparent gas leak ignited a massive fireball. The blast could be heard miles away, and debris rained down on the city's streets. At least 17 people were injured, and the casino was reduced to rubble.

Trump, who formerly owned the casino, told reporters that he had left management of the property to his subordinates and was not involved in day-to-day operations.

"I'm just a investor," Trump said. "I'm not responsible for what happens at the casino."

Federal and state investigators have narrowed their focus to a ruptured gas line near the casino's underground parking garage as the likely cause of the explosion. But they have not ruled out other possibilities, including arson or terrorism.
