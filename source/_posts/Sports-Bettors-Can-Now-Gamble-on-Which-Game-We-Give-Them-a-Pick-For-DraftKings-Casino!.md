#  Sports Bettors Can Now Gamble on Which Game We Give Them a Pick For DraftKings Casino!

The Daily Fantasy Sports site, DraftKings, which up until now has been mostly known for its online Fantasy Sports contests where players compete for cash and prizes by picking teams of real life athletes, is venturing into the world of brick-and-mortar casinos with the launch of its new Gaming Platform.

The new gaming platform will offer casino games such as slot machines, roulette and blackjack, as well as a sports book where players can gamble on the outcomes of real sporting events. But what might be most interesting to sports fans is that DraftKings is also giving its customers the chance to place bets on which game the company will give them a free pick for.

On the DraftKings website, customers are invited to make a "guess" on which game the company will provide its free pick for, with a prize of $1,000 awarded to the customer who guesses correctly. The contest runs from September 1st to September 30th, with daily entries allowed.

DraftKings is obviously hoping that this new gaming platform will help it compete against bigger rivals such as Las Vegas Sands Corporation and Wynn Resorts Ltd. Both of these companies have extensive casino operations in Macau and Las Vegas, and have been able to generate much higher profits than DraftKings.

While it's still early days for DraftKings' new Gaming Platform, if it can manage to attract even a small percentage of the more than 55 million people who currently gamble in the United States each year it could be a major boost to the company's bottom line.

#  It's Time to Start Picking Your Games: Sports Bettors Can Now Gamble on Which Sport They Want to Play at DraftKings Casino!

DraftKings Casino has announced that it will now offer its customers the ability to wager on which sport they want to play. This is a major shift for the company and for sports betting as a whole, as it opens up the possibility for people to bet on sports that they are passionate about and might have knowledge about.

The new feature is available now on the DraftKings website and allows players to choose from a variety of sports, including football, basketball, baseball, soccer, golf, and motor racing. Players can then make bets on individual matchups or entire tournaments.

"We're always looking for ways to give our customers the best gaming experience possible, and this latest update allows them to bet on the sports they love," said Matt Kalman, spokesperson for DraftKings Casino. "We anticipate that this will be a popular addition among our players."

Kalman is correct; this new feature is likely to be popular among players. It gives them more control over their betting experience and allows them to focus on the sports that they know best. This could lead to better results for players, as they will be able to make more informed bets based on their own knowledge and understanding of the sport.

It's also worth noting that this feature could help to increase interest in certain sports. For example, if you're a fan of soccer but don't know much about American football, you can now bet on soccer games without having to worry about learning all about American football too. This could lead more people to become interested in betting on sports, which can only be good news for DraftKings Casino and the gambling industry as a whole.
