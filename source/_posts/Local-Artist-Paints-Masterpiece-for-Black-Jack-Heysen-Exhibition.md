#  Local Artist Paints Masterpiece for Black Jack Heysen Exhibition

A local artist has painted a masterpiece for the Black Jack Heysen Exhibition at the Naracoorte Regional Art Gallery.

Linda Field, who has been painting since she was a child, says the opportunity to paint a tribute to Heysen was too good to miss.

“I’ve always loved his work and I’m so honoured to have been given this opportunity,” Linda says.

The painting is a beautiful landscape of the rolling hills around Hatherleigh, and it’s already attracting a lot of attention from visitors to the exhibition.

Linda is no stranger to acclaim, with her work having been exhibited all over the country. But she says this painting is extra special to her.

“It feels like I’ve finally found my voice as an artist with this piece, and I can’t wait to see what people think of it,” she says.

#  Historic Painting by Black Jack Heysen Goes on display in Regional Gallery

A painting by noted South Australian artist Black Jack Heysen is back on public display for the first time in more than two decades.

The Regional Gallery in Mount Barker will host the exhibition of Heysen’s 1957 work, “Homeward Bound”, from Saturday.

The oil-on-canvas painting, featuring gum trees and rural landscapes, has been held in a private collection since it was last shown in public in Townsville, Queensland, in 1995.

Heysen expert Peter Pinson said the painting was one of the artist’s most famous and important works.

“It is a landscape of great beauty, both internally and externally … one can understand why it has been so popular over the years with both art critics and the general public alike,” he said.

Regional Gallery director Tony Fryer said he was thrilled to be able to exhibit the painting.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for local residents and visitors to see a significant piece of Australian art history,” he said.

#  Passion for Painting: The Life of Black Jack Heysen

A shy and unassuming boy, Black Jack Heysen was to become one of Australia’s most renowned painters. From a young age, he displayed a passion for painting which would stay with him his entire life. Despite enduring many personal hardships, Heysen never stopped painting, producing an astonishing body of work which is today celebrated both in Australia and around the world.

Heysen was born in 1911 in Hahndorf, South Australia. His father was a cabinetmaker and the family were keen artists, often painting and sketching together. Heysen’s love of painting developed during his teenage years when he started using oil paints to create landscapes based on the hills and valleys near his home. In 1930, aged just 19, Heysen held his first solo exhibition in Adelaide and soon after began teaching art at the local high school.

However, Heysen’s life was not always easy. In 1941 his first wife died suddenly from tuberculosis and a few years later he lost his son in a freak accident. He also battled health problems throughout his life, including arthritis which made it difficult for him to paint large canvases. Despite these challenges, Heysen continued to produce art until his death in 1985 at the age of 74.

Heysen’s paintings are known for their strong sense of light and colour, as well as their depictions of Australian landscape and architecture. Many of his works are now considered masterpieces, including ‘The Hill at Hahndorf’ (1937), ‘Gums by the Creek’ (1945) and ‘ Port Jackson Evening’ (1976). His paintings are held in collections all over the world, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Today, Black Jack Heysen is recognised as one of Australia’s most important painters. His work has had a huge influence on subsequent generations of artists and he is considered to be one of the fathers of Australian Impressionism. Thanks to his passion for painting, Heysen has left behind a remarkable legacy that is still enjoyed by millions of people today.

#  Black Jack Heysen: His Life and Art

Born in 1877, Black Jack Heysen was one of the great Australian artists of the 20th century. A landscape painter of extraordinary talent, his work captured the beauty and spirit of the Australian outback like no other.

Heysen spent his early years in the small town of Hahndorf in South Australia. It was here that he developed a love for the Australian landscape, drawn to its wide open spaces and rugged beauty. In 1905 he moved to Adelaide, where he studied at the South Australian School of Art.

It was during this time that Heysen began to develop his unique style as a landscape painter. He was interested in capturing the natural light and colours of the Australian outback, and often used bold colours and strong brushstrokes to express this. His paintings are full of life and vitality, capturing the dramatic landscapes of Australia in all their glory.

Heysen's art career took off in the 1920s, with several solo exhibitions and awards won along the way. His work was highly sought after by collectors both in Australia and overseas, with several pieces finding their way into prestigious art galleries around the world.

In 1941 Heysen was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Adelaide for his contribution to Australian art. By this time he was considered one of Australia's most respected artists, with a reputation that stretched far beyond our shores.

Sadly, Black Jack Heysen passed away in 1968 at the age of 91. But his legacy lives on through his wonderful paintings, which continue to capture the essence of Australia like no other artist before or since.

#  Discovering Black Jack Heysen: The Man and His Work

The long, distinguished and largely unrecognized career of Australian painter Black Jack Heysen (1911-2003) is the subject of a new book by art historian Christopher Heathcote. Published by Thames & Hudson in October 2017, the large format hardback monograph is the most comprehensive account to date of Heysen’s life and work.

Heathcote first encountered Heysen’s paintings as a schoolboy on trips to the Art Gallery of South Australia (AGSA) in Adelaide. “I was very struck by their power and immediacy,” he tells me when I visit his home in London. “The colours were so strong and there was a real sense of physicality in the way he painted trees, landscapes and figures. I was hooked!

Born near Mount Barker, south of Adelaide, Heysen was one of Australia’s most prominent artists by the time of his death in 2003 at the age of 91. He exhibited extensively both locally and overseas, won numerous prizes, and his work is represented in leading public and private collections around the world. Yet it wasn’t always this way. Heathcote’s book charts not only the trajectory of Heysen’s painting but also the often fraught relationship between the artist and the art establishment.

Heathcote first became interested in writing about art while studying for his undergraduate degree at Oxford University in the early 1980s. “I remember thinking that it would be really great to write the kind of books I liked to read – biographies and critical studies of artists – about artists who weren’t well known outside Australia, like Heysen,” he says. After completing a Master’s degree at Cambridge University he took up a position at AGSA where he has worked for more than 30 years, first as a curator then as head of research. In that time he has written extensively on Australian art but Discovering Black Jack Heysen is his first full-length monograph.

Drawing on newly discovered archive material – including letters, sketchbooks and photographs – as well as interviews with family members and friends, Heathcote tells the story of an artist who was not afraid to challenge convention. Early on Heysen rebelled against the Australian Impressionists who were popular at the time thanks to their bright colours and loose brushstrokes. “He wanted to do something different; something more realist, more authentic, closer to nature,” Heathcote explains.

This desire for authenticity informed all aspects of Heysen’s life and work. A self-taught painter, he was determined to find his own way in art free from influence or instruction. And while other artists sought inspiration from European masters such as Cézanne and Van Gogh, Heysen looked instead to Australian landscape for his source material. As Heathcote observes: “For him it wasn’t enough just to paint pretty pictures… given that Australia is such an unusual place with its own flora and fauna, it made perfect sense for him to explore these subjects in his paintings.”

Heathcote also examines how Heysen responded to key moments in Australian history such as World War II (of which he was an active participant), Aboriginal land rights protests in the 1970s and 80s, and Australia’s bicentenary celebrations in 1988. Often working on commissions for public institutions such as post offices and banks, many of Heysen’s paintings reflect these events or embody what Heathcote calls “a heightened sense of patriotism… an attempt to capture something distinctive about being Australian.”

One painting that exemplifies this is The Road Home (1988), which commemorates 200 years since British settlement in Australia. Painted late in his career when many artists were exploring abstract expressionism or neo-expressionism, The Road Home is a traditional landscape featuring gum trees against a bright red sky. According to Heathcote: “It could be said that The Road Home marks a return to basics for Heyesn; a reaffirmation of his commitment to representational painting… an attempt to create an image that would stand as an emblematic statement about Australian identity on its bicentenary year. And succeed it does!”

While Discovering Black Jack Haysen provides an overview of Heyesn’s life and work it also contains some surprises for even long-time fans of the artist . For example , I didn't know that Haysen had designed sets for two ballets - Giselle (1949)and Ondine (1951) – nor did I know about his interest in sculpture or that some of his best-known paintings are actually watercolours .
