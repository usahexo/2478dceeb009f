<h1 id="An-Evening-with-Earth-Wind-and-Fire-at-Turning-Stone-Casino-Va-Keno"><a href="#An-Evening-with-Earth-Wind-and-Fire-at-Turning-Stone-Casino-Va-Keno" class="headerlink" title="An Evening with Earth, Wind and Fire at Turning Stone Casino Va Keno"></a>An Evening with Earth, Wind and Fire at Turning Stone Casino Va Keno</h1><p>It was an evening filled with music, memories and magic. As Earth, Wind and Fire took the stage at Turning Stone Casino in Verona, New York on Saturday, July 21, 2018, the crowd was immediately transported back in time.</p>
<p>The casino turned into a giant dance party as the Grammy-winning band played hit after hit including “September”, “Shining Star” and “Let’s Groove”. The energy was infectious as everyone from those who were born in the 1970s to millennials who grew up listening to their music danced along.</p>
<p>For many of the band members, it was a trip down memory lane. Drummer Verdine White recalled his first time seeing the band perform more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p>“This is a real honor for me because I saw them when they first started out in Chicago,” White said. “I never dreamed I would be on stage with them playing drums. It just goes to show you that dreams do come true.”</p>
<p>Earth, Wind and Fire has had its share of highs and lows over the years but has always managed to stick together as a family. That bond was evident on stage as vocalists Philip Bailey, Maurice White and Ralph Johnson traded solos and joked around with each other.</p>
<p>At one point during the show, White brought his son Verdine Jr. on stage to play bass guitar. The two seemed to have a blast jamming together as the crowd roared with approval.</p>
<p>Despite losing founding member guitarist Larry Dunn in 2017, Earth, Wind and Fire showed that they are still going strong musically. The band sounded tighter than ever and clearly enjoyed performing for their fans.</p>
<p>It was a night that will be remembered for years to come by those who were lucky enough to attend it. As Earth, Wind and Fire sang “I Am” towards the end of their set list, it felt like they were sending a message to their fans that they are indeed still alive and kicking. And we all felt pretty darn good about that!</p>
